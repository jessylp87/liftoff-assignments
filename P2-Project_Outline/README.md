## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create an app for National Parks. A database that gives details about each park, weekly temperatures, etc. I want this to contain information for several different types of hobbies. Such as photographers, hiking, biking, skiing, snowboarding, running, camping, etc. I also want users to be able to create accounts and put in additional info such as peak fall foiliage or snow. As of now I have to be in several different facebook groups to get this current information. I want to create an app where this can all be in one place instead of searching different websites and facebook groups. I want current info, not info from years ago or averages. I know several people personally that would love all of this info to be in the same place. I'm a landscape photographer and planning trips to certain locations for certain peak seasons can be tricky. An example, Colorado typically has peak fall foliage in mid September, but due to global changes, so does the weather. This year the peak fall foliage was the last few days of September to the second week of October. I only know this because of a facebook group dedicated to Colorado. If I had gone off of information from other websites, I would've planned a trip during mid September and missed the fall colors. 
### Features
User login: Users can create an account to be able to log in on the app and create their own profile.
Parks: This will have a list of the National Parks throughout the United States, along with descriptions of each park.
Search: User can search specific things they'd like to do or see and it will list popular parks for those things by keywords.
My List: User can create a list of places they'd like to see or things they'd like to do. Like a Bucket List. 
Park Maps: User can download a map of the park. This could come in handy since most National Parks do not have cell service.
### Technologies
I'll be using JS. I'm not sure what all of the technologies will be that I'll have to use yet.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn how to create a downloadable file for the Park Maps feature. I'll also have to learn how to pull info by keywords for the Search feature.
